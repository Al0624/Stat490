Show $$E(MSA) = \sigma^2 + \frac{JK}{I-1} \sum_i \alpha_i^2$$
\\We know that $E(MSA) = E(\frac{SSA}{df_A}) = E(\frac{SSA}{I - 1})$
\\We also know that $$SSA = \sum_i JK(\hat{x}_i - \hat{x})^2 \Rightarrow JK\sum_i (\hat{x}_i^2 - 2\hat{x}_i\hat{x} + \hat{x}^2)$$
\\Hence by substituting, we get $$E(MSA) = E(\frac{JK}{I -1} \sum_i (\hat{x}_i^2 - 2\hat{x}_i\hat{x} + \hat{x}^2)) \Rightarrow \frac{JK}{I - 1} \sum_i (E[\hat{x}_i^2] - 2E[\hat{x}_i]E[\hat{x}] + E[\hat{x}^2]) \Rightarrow$$
$$\frac{JK}{I - 1} \sum_i (Var(\hat{x}_i) - E[\hat{x}_i]^2 - 2E[\hat{x}_i]E[\hat{x}] + var(\hat{x}) - E[\hat{x}]^2) \Rightarrow$$
$$E(MSA) = \sigma^2 + \frac{JK}{I - 1} \sum_i \alpha_i^2$$

a) $DF_B = 3$
\\$SS_A = 0.0002$
\\$MS_B = SS_B / DF_B = 60.126$
\\$MS_{Interaction} = 8.479/3 = 2.8263$
\\$MSE = 19.8496$
\\F values are the corresponding MS divided by MSE.
\\$F_A = 0.0002 / 19.8496 = 0.00001$
\\$F_B = 3.0291$
\\$F_{Interaction} = 0.1424$
\\From the F table, we get the P values.
\\$P_A = 0.998$
\\$P_B = 0.093$
\\$P_{Interaction} = 0.932$
\\
\\b) 4 levels were used for factor B.
\\
\\c) 2 replicates of the experiment were performed.
\\
\\d) We can conclude that Factor B is significant at the $10\%$ significance level (p value of 0.093), but factor A and the interaction between A and B are not significant.

\\To get the highest yield, we want to set pressure to 215, and temperature to 170.

\\For the Pressure factor, we primarily see a difference of means between 215 and both 200 and 230 pressures.

\\Temperature is the significant factor at the 0.05 significance level.
\\The test for nonadditivity returns a p value of 0.2794 which is greater than 0.05.

\\At the 0.05 significance level, both doping and temperature are significant. However, their interaction is not significant at the 0.05 significance level.

\\We can conclude that both Anchor and Density are significant at the 0.05 confidence level. However their interaction is not significant at the 0.05 confidence level.

\\Compared to the factorial design, the factorial blocking design does not seem too useful.
$$\hat{\sigma}_\beta^2 = \frac{MS_B - MS_E}{ab} = \frac{103 - 21}{6} = 13.67$$

\\Note: A: Bit Size, B: Cutting Speed.
\\In order to reduce vibration, a smaller bit size is preferred. When using a small bit size, both cutting speeds produce similar vibrations. Hence, in order to reduce vibrations, the recommended bit size is small.

\\Yes, according to the residual plots the data does not seem to be normal.

\\The transformation is useful because it makes the distribution approximately normal as shown by the transformed residual and QQ plots.
